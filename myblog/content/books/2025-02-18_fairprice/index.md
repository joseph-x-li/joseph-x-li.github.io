## Notes
 - I purchased this book after seeing it in a NTUC FairPrice store when I visited Singapore in 2023.
 - Many Singaporeans have told me that everyone refers to NTUC FairPrice simply as "NTUC". 
 - Events in the summary are presented as they were from the book with no fact-checking.

## Summary
 - Chapter 1: NTUC Fairprice is created 
   - NTUC (National Trades Union Congress) was founded in 1961 and is the only labor union congress in Singapore. It is similar in purpose to AFL-CIO in the United States. 
   - In the 70s, Singapore experienced heavy inflation. The book never explicitly explains why, but the 1973 oil crisis likely played a part.
   - In response to high prices and profiteering during this time, the NTUC launches its first cooperative grocery store in Toa Payoh, called "NTUC Welcome".

   - PAP MP Phey Yew Kok launches two other cooperative grocery stores under SILO union and PIEU union. He is charged with misappropriation of funds and fleeds the country, leaving these two stores leaderless. 
   - SILO and PIEU merge in 1981 to form SEC.
   - SEC merges into NTUC Welcome in 1983 to form NTUC FairPrice.

 - Chapter 2: FairPrice Housebrand
   - The first product FairPrice sells under no brand is rice. 
   - NTUC formally launches its housebrand "FairPrice" in 1985.

 - Chapter 3: Overseas Expansion
   - FairPrice attempts to expand into China, forming a joint venture "Nextmall" in 2003 with mainland partners.
   - The joint venture over-expands in China, leading to massive losses as they open unprofitable stores.
   - FairPrice fails to expand in Malaysia and Myanmar too. They find success in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam with four "Co.opXtra" hypermarts.

 - Chapter 4: Fresh Foods
   - FairPrice Launches "Pasar", a brand for fresh foods.

 - Chapter 5: Convenience Stores
   - FairPrice decides to open convenience stores in the mid 1990s, competing with 7-Eleven which had 100 stores in Singapore at that time.
   - They open 13 stores far away from existing 7-Eleven locations before exiting stealth in the year 2000. 
   - Growth is tough because 7-Eleven has already taken the good locations. Additionally, sales of hot food items must compete with hawker centers, crushing sales.
   - FairPrice is given a great opportunity to expand when ExxonMobil decides to offload operations of gas-station conveninece stores to someone else and picks FairPrice.
   - In 2005, FairPrice takes over all 77 Esso gas station convenience stores. Esso is the brand name of ExxonMobil's gasoline.
   - FairPrice operates two convenicnce store brands: Cheers and FairPrice Xpress. Cheers is strictly a convenience store, while Xpress consists of a mini grocery store in addition to the convenience store.
