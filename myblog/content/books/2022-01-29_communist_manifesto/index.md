## Summary
 - Preface
   - The "fundemental proposition" is that the prevailing mode of economic activity (production and exchange) defines the primary intellectual and poltical events of a given period of time.
   - Author believes that, at the time of writing, a revolution where the proletariat rise up requires class distinctions and oppression to be erased from society at large.
