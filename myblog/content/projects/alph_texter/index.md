## about

{{ github() }} [Github⇗](https://github.com/joseph-x-li/py-alphabet-texter)  
{{ youtube() }} [Demo⇗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CjnURi6ZwM)

Includes basic functionality of typical typing-test programs (typeracer, 10 fast fingers).  
Green/Red highlights correct and incorrect keystrokes.

I used this to help boost my alphabet typing speed. My best time is 1.8s roughly.


## how it works
    
A matplotlib pyplot is embedded as a tkinter widget. It is animated and updates the bar graph 10 times a second. 

Includes functionality for A-Z, Z-A, A-Z (With Spaces), Z-A (With Spaces), A-Z (Shuffled)
