## about

{{ github() }}[Githubâ‡—](https://github.com/joseph-x-li/fb-duolingo)  

Just do your Duolingo lessons so Duo won't come for your family.

I originally made this because my friend Konwoo had trouble keeping his streak.

## how it works

The script is run daily using a cronjob. It calls Duolingo and Fbchat APIs to check streaks and send messages. Extendible to multiple users.

Random time delays are incorporated to prevent Facebook logging me out of my account.
