In my fall 2022 semester at CMU, I took Anish Singhani's student-taught course (98-154) about open source hardware. The final project was to write a small RTL application to be taped out on Google's [SKY130 process node](https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk) via the [tiny-tapeout project](https://tinytapeout.com/).

I decided to implement multiplication of two 8-bit floating point numbers because I had just completed an internship at Nvidia where I tested  various 8-bit floating point training schemes for BERT, in service of the new Nvida Hopper chips being released later that year.

My system-verilog project:
