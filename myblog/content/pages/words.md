They used to be written down on an index card inside my desk. Then, I moved them to a spreadsheet. Now, they are here.

These are the ones that I often find myself thinking about in the middle of the day.

 - You are the average of your five closest friends.
 - Being on time is not a talent.
   - When I was an intern at IBM, they put us all in a giant video call and gave out a bunch of advice. This is the only one that stuck.
 - For every hour you dedicate to learning, dedicate two to application. Impose a limit on your research time.
 - 99% of people do not step out of their comfort zone.
 - An alarm is a promise you made to yourself. Do not break that promise.
   - I think I made this one up.
 - As you become an adult, you realize that things around you weren't just always there; people made them happen.  
   But only recently have I started to internalize how much tenacity *everything* requires.  
   That hotel, that park, that railway. The world is a museum of passion projects.  
   â€” John Collison, Co-founder of Stripe
 - It works IF you keep going.
