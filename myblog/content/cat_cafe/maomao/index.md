## about


**Location:** Saratoga, CA  
**Owner:** Joseph Li and his family  
**Breed:** Domestic Short Hair Mix  
**Sex:** Female  

Maomao was called Furball before we adopted her. The name we gave her means "fur fur" in Chinese which translates to furry (adj).

Maomao is a very carefree cat. She will let you pick her up and play with her (I abuse this a bit). Unlike Taotao, Maomao is brave enough to hunt the live mice/rats we give her. When I say give her, I mean lock in a shower with her. She has gotten stuck in a tree, tried to fish in my fish tank, and fell in our pool.
